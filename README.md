# Modus' OpenJDK Images ðŸ“¦

The [Docker Official Images](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images) project provides and maintains application runtimes packaged in images, such as [OpenJDK images](https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk). Because Dockerfiles are not sufficently expressive, OpenJDK image build relies on [Dockerfile templates](https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/blob/c6190d5cbbefd5233c190561fda803f742ae8241/Dockerfile-linux.template), [bash scripts](https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/blob/abebf9325fea4606b9759fb3b9257ea3eef40061/apply-templates.sh), as well as [jq and awk processing](https://github.com/docker-library/bashbrew/blob/master/scripts/jq-template.awk). Often, this serves as a method to conditionally execute instruction, or select between configuration strings. The templated Dockerfile approach has several shortcomings: it requires developing and maintaining ad-hoc, complicated and error-prone string processing scripts, and makes parallelisation less efficient.

[Modus](https://modus-continens.com) is a language for building OCI container images. Compared to Dockerfiles, Modus makes it easier to define complex, parameterized builds with zero loss in efficiency w.r.t. build time or image sizes. Furthermore, Modus can make image creation faster via more effective parallelisation. Modus provides a cohesive system that replaces the need for Dockerfile templating, and most of the surrounding ad-hoc scripts. Another advantages of Modus is that using it requires you to think *explicitly* about the ways in which your builds can vary. In contrast, the official images *implicitly* define this through their [JSON versions file](https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/blob/master/versions.json): it is not sufficient on its own to understand which configurations are valid, since one also needs to check the other scripts or template files. For example, one would need to [check their templating script](https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/blob/ce82579fcff27d724a50ceaa4f1c140ac0102f39/apply-templates.sh#L47-L49) to realize that Oracle-based JRE images are unsupported.

## Code Size

A [single 315 line Modusfile](./linux.Modusfile) holds the conditional logic that defines all the varying image builds. In contrast, the templating approach requires a [332 line template file](https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/blob/c6190d5cbbefd5233c190561fda803f742ae8241/Dockerfile-linux.template), a [77 line script](https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/blob/abebf9325fea4606b9759fb3b9257ea3eef40061/apply-templates.sh) to apply the template, and a [140 line file](https://github.com/docker-library/bashbrew/blob/master/scripts/jq-template.awk) that defines some helper functions using awk and jq, totally 549 LoC.

## Build Time - 6 core machine & WSL2

We compared performance of the official Dockerfiles and our Modusfile. To provide a baseline for our performance tests, we first built the official Dockerfiles sequentially using a shell script `time fdfind Dockerfile$ | rg -v windows | xargs -I % sh -c 'docker build . -f %'`:

We also built the Dockerfiles in parallel using GNU's `parallel` (to replicate Modus' approach of parallel builds) `time fdfind Dockerfile$ | rg -v windows | parallel --bar docker build . -f {}`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46009390/153932239-203272f5-2347-40c2-80c3-2c9d9cb8b67f.png)

We then executed Modus using the command `time modus build . 'openjdk(A, B, C)' -f <(cat *.Modusfile)` to build all available images.

These experiments were executed on a [Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10400F CPU @ 2.90GHz](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/products/sku/199278/intel-core-i510400f-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-30-ghz/specifications.html) with 6 total cores, and with 8GiB of RAM.
The commands were executed under WSL2. All builds were executed with empty Docker build cache.

The baseline, building images _sequentially_ from the official Dockerfiles, took __16:46__ minutes to build 42 images. Building those same 42 images with `parallel` took **5:14** minutes.
Our approach, using Modus, took **4:54** minutes to build the same 42 images. The performance improvements from using Modus is due to the parallel build performed by our front-end to BuildKit, in addition to an image caching optimization.

## Build Time - AWS EC2 (t2.xlarge)

Full details on the t2.xlarge hardware are [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t2/).
To account for hardware differences on the t2.xlarge instance, we reran the baseline.

Official Dockerfiles executed in parallel with `time fdfind Dockerfile$ | rg -v windows | parallel --bar docker build . -f {}`:

Modusfiles built with `time modus build . 'openjdk(A, B, C)' -f <(cat *.Modusfile)`:

The parallel baseline approach took **5m14**, whereas our approach using Modus took **4m55**.


## Building Subset of Images

An example of a typical use case, such as building all versions of JDK on a particular base image (slim-bullseye):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46009390/153935512-c2122052-bae8-44e8-b7ae-2d7a7f3fa226.png)

We're able to build 5 versions in **1:16** minutes.

## Image Efficiency

We used [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) which provides an estimate of image efficiency. 
An example of an 'inefficiency' would be moving files across layers - this is a change that needs to be recorded as part of the layer, yet could be avoided by rewriting the Dockerfile.

All the images we built scored over 95% image efficiency:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46009390/152662059-67ecc65e-6b41-4dc8-b18a-082e98597bd5.png)

The official OpenJDK images also score highly on image efficiency (all above 95%), but at a cost to readability and separability.
Nearly [half of their Dockerfile](https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/blob/ffcc4b9190be32ed7c4c92f6aa8fe2463da291d6/Dockerfile-linux.template#L187-L332) is a single `RUN` layer, to avoid the issue of modifications recorded in the layer diffs bloating the image size.

Modus provides a `merge` operator to solve this issue, which helped us achieve high image efficiency scores. `merge` is an operator that will merge the underlying commands of an expression into one `RUN` layer.

https://github.com/modus-continens/openjdk-images-case-study/blob/5c9783c4cc9d37ab56da529434e876de1f422219/linux.Modusfile#L267-L271

In this case, if we remove the `merge`, the image efficiency drops to about 75%. One operation that contributes to the inefficiency is updating `cacerts` in a separate `RUN` layer, and there may be other similar operations performed within the body of this `merge` that create a new layer with _avoidable_ diffs.

This demonstrates that `merge` facilitates the best of both worlds: the readability of separating out sections of code without the inefficiency of more layers recording more diffs.

# OpenJDK Configuration

Below is a list that shows the ways in which our OpenJDK configuration can 'vary', heavily inspired by the [official approach taken](https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk):
- Major application version
- Full version
- Java Type (JDK vs JRE)
- Base image variants (e.g. bullseye, buster, alpine3.15)
- AMD64 Binary URL
- ARM64 Binary URL
- Source

The variables exposed to a user are (a subset of the above):
- Major application version
- Java Type
- Variant

So a user may request a goal of `openjdk(A, "jdk", "alpine3.15")` to build all versions of JDK on Alpine.

## Notes on Docker's Official Workflow

This attempts to be a tldr for https://github.com/docker-library/official-images,
specific to OpenJDK.
This may not be entirely accurate.

- `update.sh` calls `versions.sh` and `apply-templates.sh`.
- `versions.sh` updates `versions.json`
- `generate-stackbrew-library.sh` generates a summary of the available
images in a well-defined format (shared amongst similar repos).
- `apply-templates.sh` applies the linux/windows Dockerfile template using
jq/awk. This seems to use shared helper functions from bashbrew.
- The GH action jobs are generated using bashbrew, essentially based on
the different combinations of images allowed.

A good short example of an improvement over their template file is https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/blob/f8d1fd911fdcad985d7a534e3470a9c54c87d45f/Dockerfile-linux.template#L36-L60.
